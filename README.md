• The Hotel Management System helps the manager to manage the hotel more effectively and efficiently by computerizing meal ordering and billing simultaneously.

• This system is developed to automate day to day activities of a hotel.

• Food Farm include varieties of food from different parts of the country.

• We have deployed some of the unique features making it different from the existing websites.

• This management system can be used by the employees in the hotel to handle the client’s orders in a fair and a well-mannered way.

• To order a meal online, the customer has to login first, only then he can access the later part of the site. Finally after making the necessary payment a transcript will be generated in the name of the customer. To cut short.

• This project will facilitate customer to order food online even in this pandemic situation with all the safety measures being followed.
